      <h1>30+ Things from Brazil That Seem Weird, Irritating, or Really Cool to Foreigners</h1>

      <p>
        When we travel to another country, everything is new and a source of curiosity: the way people behave, how they dress, what music they listen to, the rules of etiquette, what they like to eat. We may find some habits that are different, weird or even so charming that we end up adopting them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a foreigner visits Brazil (or has Brazilians visit their country), it’s clear that they will also notice our way of doing things. Stuff that we do on a daily basis, and that seems very natural to us, is sometimes viewed with surprise or disbelief by outsiders. In some cases, in a positive way. In others, we may fall short.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the reports of several travellers, Incrível.club made a list of what our friends think of us. What do they find the funniest, weirdest, most awe-inspiring, or even most annoying about our habits? The answers follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Hugging and touching — We are very warm, we like hugs. It's a plus, no doubt. But some more reserved peoples are not used to this kind of intimacy. Therefore, hugs and touches can be considered invasive to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Kisses on the cheek as a form of greeting — Same rule as above applies. Some cultures consider kissing on the cheek very intimate. “In the UK, only pretentious and boring people or old aunts you haven't seen for a long time do that”, said an internet user in a forum about annoying habits of Brazilians.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Sending hugs and kisses at the end of an email — Yes, we are so into kissing and we like to hug so much that we even express this affection via email or WhatsApp. Some foreigners find it unusual, but it is not a negative, no.

      </p>


      <p>
        4. Making plans and not meeting up — we have that way of saying “let's plan” or “let's keep talking”. Or to invite — “drop by the house!” — and nobody actually gets together. For foreigners, especially Europeans, who are very practical, an invitation is an invitation and must be respected. They don't quite understand our lack of commitment.

      </p>


      <p>
        5. Our tendency to be consistently late — We’ve got to hand it to them.They are absolutely right!

      </p>


      <p>
        6. Few people speak English in Brazil — This is a repeated complaint in several written forums by foreigners who have visited us. When it comes to communicating, things get complicated. Although we love welcoming people from abroad and doing anything to help, they are right: only 5% of Brazilians speak English.

      </p>


      <p>
        7. Store clerks who make suggestions and want to push merchandise — You know that habit our clerks have of offering a blouse, a belt, an accessory? This annoys many foreign tourists, who are used to making their choices without outside interference.

      </p>

      <p>
        8. Our approach to verbal communication is sometimes very direct — “Please”, “excuse me”, “thank you”, etc., are sometimes not very common words in our vocabulary and in our relationships with those who provide services. This is noticed by foreigners in Brazilians who are traveling abroad. A tip for us to improve!

      </p>


      <p>
        9. Showering every day — And sometimes more than once a day. Foreigners from cold countries find our main hygiene habit odd.

      </p>


      <p>
        10. Taking a toothbrush, toothpaste and dental floss to work — Yes, some people find that strange. But our oral health appreciates it!

      </p>


      <p>
        11. Throwing toilet paper in the trash— It's okay that we were culturally conditioned to avoid clogs and that's why we have the habit of using the wastebasket in homes and public places. But let's face it, it's really not one of the healthiest things to let used toilet paper pile up.

      </p>


      <p>
        12. Having more than one bathroom in the house - Or one for each room, apart from the half bathroom, in upper-class homes. In middle-class apartments in Europe, for example, it's a bathroom for the whole gang, if that.

      </p>


      <p>
        13. Having a bidet in the bathroom — Sure, modern architecture is already moving beyond this fixture. The habit of installing bidets in the bathroom was imported by Brazilians from France, but it is not very common in the rest of the world.

      </p>


      <p>
        14. Sharing food and drink — “Want to have a bite of my sandwich?” For Americans and Europeans, for example, this is not a very pleasant proposition. Sounds a bit gross.

      </p>


      <p>
        15. Our barbecue obsession — As in certain countries beef is an expensive item (here, it used to be cheaper), some foreigners are surprised by the abundance of our barbecues or our rodízios. A point for us in terms of eating!

      </p>


      <p>
        16. Eating avocado as a sweet treat — In almost every other country in the world, avocado is a fruit that is prepared as a snack. In Chile, they even put avocado on hot dogs. In Mexico, there is the famous guacamole. There are those who freak out when, in Brazil, they see us eating avocado with sugar.

      </p>


      <p>
        17. The variety of our fruits — Foreigners learn that the traditional caipirinha recipe uses cachaça, lime and sugar — which is absolutely correct. But they are amazed when they get here and discover that there are caipirinhas made with pineapple, cashew, tangerine, lemon, strawberry, kiwi, surinam cherry, carambola... And a variety of mixed fruits!

      </p>


      <p>
        18. Sweet pizzas — Blogger Denise, of German origin, considers pizzas topped with pineapple or Nutella to be an insult to Italians. Even having lived for 2 and a half years in Brazil, she didn't get used to the idea.

      </p>


      <p>
        19. Using a napkin to eat anything with your hands — Isn't it weird that they think that's weird? But we prefer not to get our hands greasy with kibbeh and coxinha!

      </p>


      <p>
        20. Couples sitting next to each other in a restaurant — Isn't it romantic? It makes kissing so much easier... But there are foreigners who are not used to this configuration, who knows why. By the way, kissing in public places is frowned upon in certain countries.​

      </p>


      <p>
        21. Addressing people by their first name — Those who find this behavior weird are people from the corporate world, who abroad have a more formal way of addressing others, like “Mr. Smith” here and “Mr. Souza” there. Asking “What did you think of our project, Ronald?”  may sound strange to an American executive.​

      </p>


      <p>
        22. Our long goodbyes — Do you know when the group leaves a club, bar or restaurant and says goodbye, but there's still one more chat... and more kisses, more goodbyes? And it never ends? For some foreigners, this farewell ritual that seems endless, typical of Brazilians, can seem a little funny.

      </p>


      <p>
        23. Wearing speedos on beaches — Americans, for example, find speedos that Brazilian males wear to go to the beach strange. There is even discussion on the internet about the topic. There they prefer longer, baggier shorts, and they find our beach look a little dubious. 
      </p>


      <p>
        24. Our high rate of plastic surgery — In some parts of the world, it's considered inappropriate to ask someone if they've had any type of cosmetic surgery. Here, on the contrary, the new shape of a nose or the elimination of a double chin becomes the hot topic. Brazil is the runner-up in plastic surgery and loses only to the United States. But, as we have already said, it’s not in good taste to comment on the subject there.

      </p>


      <p>
        25. Bus fare collector and gas station attendant — These professions do not exist in most countries, where citizens have prepaid public transport for a certain period (or buy tickets at electronic machines) and fill up with gasoline through a self-service system.

      </p>

      </p>


      <p>
        26. Waving down the bus for it to stop — In large cities in Europe or North America, buses stop at all stops. Here, if we don't wave the bus down, we run the risk of missing the ride we've been waiting for for a long time.

      </p>

      <p>
        27. Our high number of holidays — In all, we have 12 national holidays, not counting those decreed by states and municipalities and those dedicated to certain professional categories, such as Teacher's Day. For some foreigners, it's a mess. Other countries, such as Colombia and India, however, are more “lazy” and have 18 holidays a year.​

      </p>


      <p>
        28. The excessive use of plastic bags — Many first world countries have already abolished plastic bags in supermarkets and stores. Therefore, some foreigners are amazed to see someone leave the market in Brazil with more than 10 bags in their hands. Although some Brazilian municipalities have adopted restrictive measures on the use of plastic in commerce, we still do not have a national standard for the subject.

      </p>

      <p>
        29. Our street art — Monica, author of the blog Not a Nomad, was stunned by the color and variety of graffiti on the streets of São Paulo. She is American and lives in Berlin, where street art is also highly encouraged, but she believes that Brazilian graffiti artists are at a higher level of artistic expression. She cites muralist Kobra as one of those who most impressed her.

      </p>

      <p>
        30. Our diversity — The mix of so many peoples is expressed in the richness of our culture, our cuisine and our attitude. The diversity of Brazil enchants those who come from abroad.

      </p>

      <p>31. Our hospitality — We are good hosts — is what most foreign observers say. “Brazilians will literally go out of their way to help you get somewhere”, points out the Wanderful World blog.</p>
