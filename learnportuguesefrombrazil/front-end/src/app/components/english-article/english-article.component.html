      <h1>Survey: Well-being Worsens, but Employers Don't Notice</h1>

      <p>
        Do you ever think your boss doesn't understand how you feel?
        If so, you're far from alone, according to a survey of well-being in the workplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most employees feel their well-being at work has worsened or stayed the same since 2022, the survey by Workplace
        Intelligence and Deloitte found.
      </p>

      <p>
        It said many employees are "struggling with unacceptably low levels of well-being."
        But most senior managers actually think their employees' well-being is getting better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The survey included 3,150 senior managers, junior managers and employees in the US, Canada, the UK and
        Australia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only 36% of employees said their physical well-being has improved, while 33% said their mental well-being has
        improved.
      </p>

      <p>
        But among the senior managers, 80% said they believed their employees' physical well-being is better in 2023,
        and 77% said their employees' mental well-being has improved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deloitte said well-being at work has worsened for most people since the coronavirus pandemic.
        And it said managers are struggling with their own poor well-being at work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three-quarters of senior managers, 64% of junior managers and 60% of employees said they are thinking about
        leaving their job for one that would "better support their well-being."

      </p>

      <p>
        However, this is nothing new. A survey by Adecco in 2022 also found that 45% of employees thought their
        employers did not offer enough support for their well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deloitte said 85% of managers plan to do more for their employees' well-being over the next two years.
      </p>

      <p>
        But 70% of managers said problems such as company policies, too much work, and an "unsupportive workplace
        culture" make it hard for them to support employees' well-being.
      </p>
