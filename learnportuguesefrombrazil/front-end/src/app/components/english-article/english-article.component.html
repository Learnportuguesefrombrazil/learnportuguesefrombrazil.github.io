      <h1>How to Cook the Perfect Steak</h1>

      <p>
        Whether you enjoy your steak rare, well-done, or something in between, according to experts, there are a few
        things you should know if you're cooking it at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Begin by taking the steak out of the fridge and keeping it at room temperature for about an hour. If it's cold
        going into the pan, the middle won't cook well.You should also make sure the pan is hot before the meat goes in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some choose an oil without a strong flavor, either brushing it on the meat or pouring a little into the pan;
        some like butter, while others don't use anything at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's the same with seasoning. It depends on the sort of flavors you like ‚Äî you could add salt and pepper before
        cooking, perhaps some garlic to the pan, or add your seasoning during cooking.
      </p>

      <p>
        When cooking steak at home, people often say the meat gets too tough, so you'll need to watch it while it's in
        the pan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many websites offer advice on how long to cook a steak depending on the cut, your favorite way of cooking it,
        and how thick the steak is. So first, go online and check the length of time your meat needs.Then you'll need a
        pan that has enough space for your meat to lie flat.
      </p>

      <p>
        While it cooks, you should touch the steak with your finger to feel how soft it is. It will feel less soft as it
        cooks.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make sure it cooks all over, you could turn it after half of the cooking time ‚Äî although some experts think
        you should turn it every minute.
      </p>

      <p>Just like the cook, your steak needs to rest when it's done! When it's cooked as you like it, allow the steak
        to rest for around five minutes before serving it.</p>

      <h2>Exercise 1 Questions</h2>



      <p>
        1. Do you like steak? How often do you cook it at home?

      </p>


      <p>
        2. What meats are commonly used in your country's cuisine?

      </p>

      <p>
        3. Is your diet meat-heavy? Has this changed over time?

      </p>

      <p>
        4. Do you know anyone who'd never give up eating meat?
      </p>


      <p>
        5. Who does most of the cooking in your household?

      </p>


      <p>
        6. Are there any foods or dishes that you're an expert at making?

      </p>

      <p>
        7. Do you watch any cooking shows? If so, what are your favorites?

      </p>


      <!-- 
      <p>
        16. Eating avocado as a sweet treat ‚Äî In almost every other country in the world, avocado is a fruit that is
        prepared as a snack. In Chile, they even put avocado on hot dogs. In Mexico, there is the famous guacamole.
        There are those who freak out when, in Brazil, they see us eating avocado with sugar.

      </p>


      <p>
        17. The variety of our fruits ‚Äî Foreigners learn that the traditional caipirinha recipe uses cacha√ßa, lime and
        sugar ‚Äî which is absolutely correct. But they are amazed when they get here and discover that there are
        caipirinhas made with pineapple, cashew, tangerine, lemon, strawberry, kiwi, surinam cherry, carambola... And a
        variety of mixed fruits!

      </p>


      <p>
        18. Sweet pizzas ‚Äî Blogger Denise, of German origin, considers pizzas topped with pineapple or Nutella to be an
        insult to Italians. Even having lived for 2 and a half years in Brazil, she didn't get used to the idea.

      </p>


      <p>
        19. Using a napkin to eat anything with your hands ‚Äî Isn't it weird that they think that's weird? But we prefer
        not to get our hands greasy with kibbeh and coxinha!

      </p>


      <p>
        20. Couples sitting next to each other in a restaurant ‚Äî Isn't it romantic? It makes kissing so much easier...
        But there are foreigners who are not used to this configuration, who knows why. By the way, kissing in public
        places is frowned upon in certain countries.‚Äã

      </p>


      <p>
        21. Addressing people by their first name ‚Äî Those who find this behavior weird are people from the corporate
        world, who abroad have a more formal way of addressing others, like ‚ÄúMr. Smith‚Äù here and ‚ÄúMr. Souza‚Äù there.
        Asking ‚ÄúWhat did you think of our project, Ronald?‚Äù may sound strange to an American executive.‚Äã

      </p>


      <p>
        22. Our long goodbyes ‚Äî Do you know when the group leaves a club, bar or restaurant and says goodbye, but
        there's still one more chat... and more kisses, more goodbyes? And it never ends? For some foreigners, this
        farewell ritual that seems endless, typical of Brazilians, can seem a little funny.

      </p>


      <p>
        23. Wearing speedos on beaches ‚Äî Americans, for example, find speedos that Brazilian males wear to go to the
        beach strange. There is even discussion on the internet about the topic. There they prefer longer, baggier
        shorts, and they find our beach look a little dubious.
      </p>


      <p>
        24. Our high rate of plastic surgery ‚Äî In some parts of the world, it's considered inappropriate to ask someone
        if they've had any type of cosmetic surgery. Here, on the contrary, the new shape of a nose or the elimination
        of a double chin becomes the hot topic. Brazil is the runner-up in plastic surgery and loses only to the United
        States. But, as we have already said, it‚Äôs not in good taste to comment on the subject there.

      </p>


      <p>
        25. Bus fare collector and gas station attendant ‚Äî These professions do not exist in most countries, where
        citizens have prepaid public transport for a certain period (or buy tickets at electronic machines) and fill up
        with gasoline through a self-service system.

      </p>

        gasoline through a self-service system.
      </p>


      <p>
        26. Waving down the bus for it to stop ‚Äî In large cities in Europe or North America, buses stop at all stops.
        Here, if we don't wave the bus down, we run the risk of missing the ride we've been waiting for for a long time.

      </p>

      <p>
        27. Our high number of holidays ‚Äî In all, we have 12 national holidays, not counting those decreed by states and
        municipalities and those dedicated to certain professional categories, such as Teacher's Day. For some
        foreigners, it's a mess. Other countries, such as Colombia and India, however, are more ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and have 18
        holidays a year.‚Äã

      </p>


      <p>
        28. The excessive use of plastic bags ‚Äî Many first world countries have already abolished plastic bags in
        supermarkets and stores. Therefore, some foreigners are amazed to see someone leave the market in Brazil with
        more than 10 bags in their hands. Although some Brazilian municipalities have adopted restrictive measures on
        the use of plastic in commerce, we still do not have a national standard for the subject.

      </p>

      <p>
        29. Our street art ‚Äî Monica, author of the blog Not a Nomad, was stunned by the color and variety of graffiti on
        the streets of S√£o Paulo. She is American and lives in Berlin, where street art is also highly encouraged, but
        she believes that Brazilian graffiti artists are at a higher level of artistic expression. She cites muralist
        Kobra as one of those who most impressed her.

      </p>

      <p>
        30. Our diversity ‚Äî The mix of so many peoples is expressed in the richness of our culture, our cuisine and our
        attitude. The diversity of Brazil enchants those who come from abroad.

      </p>

      <p>31. Our hospitality ‚Äî We are good hosts ‚Äî is what most foreign observers say. ‚ÄúBrazilians will literally go out
        of their way to help you get somewhere‚Äù, points out the Wanderful World blog.</p>
