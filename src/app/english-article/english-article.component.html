            <h1>Brazilian Culture</h1>

            <p>Brazilian culture is rich and diverse, which is explained by the country's geographical and historical formation.
            </p>

            <p>Indigenous peoples, Africans and Portuguese contributed much to this construction.
            â€‹</p>

            <p>Brazilian culture is vast and diverse, our cultural habits incorporated elements and influences from indigenous peoples, Africans, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians and Japanese, among others, due to colonization, immigration and the people who already lived here.
            â€‹</p>

            <p>Characteristic elements of Brazilian culture are popular music, literature, cuisine, and traditional national festivals.
            â€‹</p>

            <h1>How was Brazilian culture born?</h1>
            <p>
                We can say that the oldest elements of genuinely Brazilian culture go back to the indigenous peoples who already inhabited the countryâ€™s territory before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500.
            â€‹</p>

            <p>Keepers of an extensive culture, the native peoples maintained their beliefs and practiced their cultural elements in alignment with a simple way of life and contact with nature.

            </p>

            <p>With the arrival of the Portuguese and the beginning of colonization, European culture was forcibly introduced to the indigenous peoples, and the missions of the Society of Jesus (made up of Jesuit priests) came to Brazil with the aim of converting the Indians.</p>

            <p>In the 19th century, Brazil experienced another migration process with Italian workers coming to work on coffee plantations.</p>

            <p>Other large significant migration flows took place during World War II, when Japanese, Germans and Jews sought refuge in Brazilian lands.</p>

            <p>All this vastness of peoples contributed to the formation of a pluralistic culture and different cultures.</p>

            <p>Geographical differences also contributed to the Brazilian cultural process becoming pluralistic and diversified.</p>
