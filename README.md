## About the project
The project is a front-end project created in Angular for the Learnportuguesefrombrazil group, it is a Language Exchange group where people can learn Portuguese and English in a very relaxed way and also make friends. This frontend project is an initial project where we created a static responsive page with Angular and Bootstrap to present some group information such as events and articles published here on this web page.
